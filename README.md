This repository contains experimental data and model code used in the manuscript:

**"Deep Learning Neural Network-Assisted Optimization of Ru/C Catalysts from Rice Straw for Enhanced Glycerol Hydrogenolysis"**

## ðŸ”¬ Contents

- `Catalyst_Surface_Properties_Table7.csv` â€” Surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter for Ru/C catalysts with different Ru loadings.
- `Catalyst_Comparison_Table8.csv` â€” Comparison of BET surface area, pore volume, and Ru size for RS0 vs RS3 activated catalysts.
- `dnn_model.py` â€” (Optional) Python code for deep neural network training and prediction.

## ðŸ§ª Description

The catalyst samples were prepared using ammonium phosphate-activated rice straw with varying Ru loadings (1â€“7 wt.%). BET, XPS, TPD, TEM, and XRD characterization data were used to train a DNN to predict glycerol conversion and selectivity.
